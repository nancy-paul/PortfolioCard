    <p>Hello. I am a Master of Computer Science student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in my third semester. I am interested in Data Science and Healthcare, but I would like to learn more about Web Programming through this course!</p>
    <p>I have internship and research experience related to Data Science and Healthcare but I hope to add a few Web Programming projects to my portfolio as well.</p>
